                <p>Scotland are through! Lydon Dykes provided a goal and assist to help Scotland on their way to an emphatic 3-1 win over Hungary with John McGinn grabbing a brace including one from the penalty spot. The squad has made history becoming the first Scotland team to make it out of the group stages at these championships, now Croatia awaits in the Round of 16. The boys are out for revenge after Croatia send us home in the 2020 championships but their squad has aged since then and there is a buzz around the Scotland camp after that win with omptomism at an all time hig. Win this and a potential Quarter-Final against bitter rivals England may await!</p>
				<p>It's the 80th minute of the match and Scotland are leading 1-0 after Ryan Porteous headed home from a corner just after half-time but know our backs are up against the wall with the Croatians throwing everything they've got at our defence they have just subbed on striker Bruno Petkovic but so far they haven't been able to break through the backline. Should we bring on another centre back to help out the defensive efforts or do you think we should keep the system the same as its's been very effective so far in the match?</p>
