                <p>Hungary 2-1 Scotland reads the final scoreline as the Scots go crashing out in the groups yet again. It's the same old story with Scotland who are still yet to reach the knockout rounds of an international tournament in our history. Che Adams was brought in for the final game but proved ineffective failing to register a shot on target in the match and being taken off after just 65 minutes. The Tartan Army head home with there hope and dreams let down once again.</p>
