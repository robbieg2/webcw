				<p>Scotland go into the championships after surprising the continent with some stunning performances during the qualifying campaign including wins against Spain and Norway, however the nation has been drawn in a tough group alongside hosts Germany, dark horses Hungary and Switzerland and it will take all the squad has got to try and push through and make it to a first ever knockout stage place. Recent form has been lacking since qualification with dissapointing losses coming from Northern Ireland and the Netherlands but Steve Clarke knows the squad well and thinks he will be able to recapture that form that got us here in the first place, but he needs your help! Have you got what it takes to help lead the nation to European Glory?  </p>
