                <p>PICKFORD SAVES and England progress to the semi-final. It was a poor penalty from Kenny McLean who hit it low to the left making it an easy stop for Pickford who guessed thr right way. It's a cruel exit for Scotland against our biggest rivals who still remain favourites to win the championships for the first time and the Tartan Army will have to watch on from home.</p>
