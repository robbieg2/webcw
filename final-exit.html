                <p>An extra-time winner from Rafael Leao sealed a second European title in 8 years for Portugal after a weak backpass from Stuart Armstrong sent Leao one on one with Gordon in goal, Scotland fans will be thinking back to the 2-2 draw with England in 2017 when Armstrong similarly let the nation down with a last minute error and this one will be a lot harder to take. So close to glory but just not enough for a historic win for the squad who will have to head home empty handed but with plenty of memories made along the way.</p>
