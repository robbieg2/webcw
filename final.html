                <p>A Man of the Match performance from Craig Gordon including a terrific double save in the second half has helped Scotland knock out giants France 1-0 after captain Andy Robertson scored from long distance on the hour mark to seal one of the most historic victory for Steve Clarke's men.</p>
				<p>Only Portugal stands in the way of glory for Scotland but with Cristiano Ronaldo playing in potentially his last international tournament will the squad have what it takes to defeat one of the greatest ever.</p>
				<p>Portugal have been having a dream tournament so far after topping their group they have knocked out Italy, Netherlands and hosts Germany on their way to the final with a young, fiery squad led by Ronaldo they are the favourites to win their second title in three tournaments after their triumphs in 2016.</p>
				<p>The final-whistle has blown and the score is 1-1 after 90 minutes. Scotland went 1-0 up in the first-half after john McGinn rounded Diogo Costa and tapped it in before hitting the siuuu infront of Ronaldo who started on the bench. Ronaldo then came off the bench and scored after 75 minutes bringing Portugal level and sending the game to extra-time. A change is needed for Scotland as the team have looked sloppy since the equaliser but who will be Steve Clarke's super sub, Ryan Christie and Stuart Armstrong are both looking eager on the bench and they both bring attacking prospects to the tiring midfield but we only have one remaining change and it could be decisive in deciding who will be champion!</p>
