                <p>It Worked! Keeping the extra attacker on the pitch proved pivotal as we hit Croatia late on the counter-attack and Ryan Christie slotted in at the back post to get Scotland the 2-0 cushion and a spot in the Quarters. It's the Auld Enemy up next for the tartan army and its really going to test what the squad is made off. England who were pre-tournament favourites to win it all are still unbeaten heading into the match with 4 wins from 4 including a thumping 3-0 win over Austria in the last round, Harry Kane is currently the top scorer on 5 goals and will be looking to add to the golden boot he won in Russia in 2018.</p>
				<p>It's been a very cagey game with both sides failing to build much on the attack and the full-time whistle has been blown at the end of extra-time with the match at 1-1. Penalties Awaits.</p>
				<p>The Scots all know what happened to England when they last faced penalties in the final in 2021 and the eyes of the nation watch on as we look to eliminate our biggest rivals in the same manner. Jordan Pickford and Angus Gunn head towards the goal ready for the shootout to begin.</p>
				<p>It all comes down to the fifth penalty for Scotland, the score stands at England 3-3 Scotland and Marcus Rashford has just sent his penalty over the crossbar meaning if Scotland score we are through. It's Kenny McLean who's walking towards the ball, he's always reliable for Scotland and is a cult hero around the country. Does he go left or does he right?</p>
