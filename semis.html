                <p>MCLEAN SCORES! Scotland have knocked out England on Penalties and sent them back home, where football will not be going with them. The tartan army go marching into the semi-final where 2022 World Cup Finalists France await the Scots. France who had a bumpy start to the group stage have found some form and have been storming through the knockout stages with a 3-0 win over Turkey and a 2-0 victory over Belgium in the last round they are looking like the team to beat going into the final stages of the tournament. With world class players throughout the squad no one will be expecting Scotland to put up a fight, but with a place in the final up for grabs anything is possible.</p>
				<p>It's the 37th minute and Angus Gunn has gone down holding his left arm. The medical staff are indicating to the bench that the keeper is going to need to come off. Worried faces watch on around the ground as Gunn walks down the tunnel with his arm in a sling. With the score still tied at 0-0 and most of the game still to play Steve Clarke has to choose between his two substitute keepers. Will it be the experience of veteren Craig Gordon or should Zander Clark be the man to try and save the tie?
