                <p>We've arrived in Stuttgart for the final group stage game against Hungary knowing that if we do not come away with 3 points we will be eliminated and sent home. It's been a tough start to the group stage falling 3-2 to the Germans in the opening match after leading at half-time through a Scott McTominay header. A late equaliser from sub Che Adams salvaged a point in the second match after coming from two down against the Swiss in Cologne. Hungary have taken 2 points from their opening games with draws against both opposition and sit second in the group. With Switzerland having to face Germany in the final match they will likely come away with nothing leaving the second place spot up for grabs meaning Scotland must beat Hungary to leapfrog them into the Round of 16.</p>
				<p>After Adams' last gasp goal in the previous game all the media talk is about who will lead the line in this crucial match with Lyndon Dykes failing to score in the competition so far many are calling for Adams to be given the chance. You have been brought in too help with the selection and the striker is the last name needing chosen. Will you go for Dykes who has started the previous two matches or will it be Che Adams based on his form in the last game!</p>
